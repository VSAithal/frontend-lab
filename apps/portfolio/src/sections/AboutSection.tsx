        I enjoy designing clean UI architectures, building reusable design systems, and ensuring accessibility and performance are first-class concerns. My work typically spans from defining component APIs and state boundaries to implementing testing strategies and supporting CI/CD pipelines.

        While React is my primary ecosystem, I’m always open to exploring new frontend frameworks and technologies when they align with product needs and long-term maintainability.
